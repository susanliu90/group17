					<p>Hello all, my name is Quizzy. For those of you who do not know who I am, I am Quizzy. I evolved from
						Quizzlittle. I have learned many new abilities and I am now much more than just a quiz builder. I am a complete app now. I can manage your classes,
							manage your students, manage your TA's, implement different grading themes, and of course build quizzes.
							If you would like to build a quiz then go to my app to build it. If you would like to learn how to build 
							a quiz, then please read below.

						<h1>Making a Quiz</h1>
					</header>
					<p>To Make a Quiz you must first start at our quiz builder. Write in your preferred quiz name and then add which ever types of questions you want. We have 6 types of questions for you to fill out : multiple-choice(single answer), multiple-choice(multiple answer), true/false, fill-in, simple answer, and short essay. As you add your question by just clicking the icons, the question format should have added and displayed dynamically on the quiz view side of the builder page. As you fill in the question content, we allow you to select your prefered correct answer or leave it at default for certain question formatts. The user may also drag the questions up and down the list to reorganize their questions. Once the user is satisfied, they will then be able to save their quiz and administer it to their students accordingly. Have fun!

						<h1>Quiz Features</h1>
					</header>
					<p>The Quizzler has many features for you to play with in our toolbox located on the right hand side of the screen including adding a timer, current point counter, question randomizer, save, preview, restart options, and a paging option for our professors. The timer, if selected, will allow the user to add a limited time to their test and select the permitted time to have the quiz administered. The Quizzler will even make your life easier with a handy point counter that will have a default point count of 1 but is able to be adjusted once you edit your individual questions. The question randomizer will ensure that each test given will randomize the order in which the user has created the quiz to discourage uncalled for behaviors in the class room. The save button will allow the user to save, the preview will allow the user to preview what they have so far, and the restart will clear what the user has on their test already just in case the user wishes to work off from a clean slate. Finally, the paging option will allow the user to select how many questions each user will see each page of their test. These features were design specifically for user ease and efficiency, so please, have fun and get started today! </p>
